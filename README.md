# TongSearch Reasoner

TongSearch Reasoner is the first query reasoner model family specifically trained for query reasoning in reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. The family includes two checkpoints in different parameter size: TongSearch Reasoner 1.5B and TongSearch Reasoner 7B. With BM25 as retriever, TongSearch Reasoner can perform closely to the state-of-the-art large reasoning models e.g. DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B. Comparing with those large-scale embedders trained for reasoning-intensive task, the approaches of using BM25 retrievers with TongSearch Reasoner reasoning is more effective and efficient since there is no need to encode the large-scale retrieval documents with large embedding models.

## Evaluating on BRIGHT Benchmark
We provide a group of scripts for evaluating the overall performance on [BRIGHT Benchmark](https://brightbenchmark.github.io/). Here are the instructions of evaluation:
- Install `vllm==0.8.4` and `pytrec_eval` first.
- Install the other dependencies requrired by the evaluation scripts of BRIGHT benchmark. More details can be found at the repo of BRIGHT Benchmark [here](https://github.com/xlang-ai/BRIGHT).
- Replace the settings in `Evaluation/run_evaluation.sh` with your own settings: `TONGSEARCH_REASONER_PATH` for the path of TongSearch Reasoner model, `BRIGHT_PATH` for the path of the BRIGHT dataset, and `REASONER_FILE_NAME` for the filename of saving reasoned queries.
- Run `Evaluation/run_evaluation.sh`

We also provide the reasoned queries generated by TongSearch Reasoner 7B and 1.5B, which are listed in `Evaluation/reasoned_queries`. You can run the following scripts to evaluate with the reasoned queries directly:
```
#Evaluate 7B results
sh run_evaluation_with_reasoned_query.sh reasoned_queries/7b_reasoned_query.json path/to/bright/dataset
#Evaluate 1.5B results
sh run_evaluation_with_reasoned_query.sh reasoned_queries/1_5b_reasoned_query.json path/to/bright/dataset
```
